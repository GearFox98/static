static-init <path> [options]
```

> **-b, --bootstrap**: gets a Bootstrap dist and installs it in the `data` folder in the project. Useful to code in places with unstable network

_Note_: If no `path` provided Static‚ö° will assume `current directory` to initialize the project.

> **check**: checks the directory structure looking for missing directories. If there are some folders missing, this command will create them. The program stops if `html` or `pages` folders are not in the directory.<br /><br />
> **build**: implies `check`, if there's no errors found, the program will generate the pages' content in a temporary folder and tailor the pieces in one file for each page in the `dist` folder.
> **run** - Serves `dist` folder of the project, if the site is not built it calls `build` command.
