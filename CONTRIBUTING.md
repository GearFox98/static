# Welcome to Static âš¡ contributing guide
Thanks for taking your time on contributing in Static project, I hope we can make this tool user-friendly and better each time.

## Getting Started
First of all, it is required you have already Python abilities. You must have tried the tool first in order to get used to its workflow.
The main goal of this project is to keep flexibility in the design of the whole site, leaving the user work only on their HTML basic interface once and mainly its content.

## Issues
If you find a problem with the program, take a look to the issues first. If there's nothing like you problem there, you can create a new one!
